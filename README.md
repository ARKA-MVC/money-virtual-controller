# Money Virtual Controller
Money Virtual Controller (MVC) is a flexible, mobile-ready, ReactJS powered money management app.

To take part in MVC's development, first you need to have `NodeJS` and `npm` installed on your computer. 
Then pull this repo to your local and do these steps:

1. Open this project in your terminal and:
  `npm run init`

2. Start both servers for development by:
  `npm run dev`

To start backend server only, please `cd` to `api` folder and run:
  `npm run dev`
The same thing happens when you want to run client server only, but `cd` to `client` folder instead.

Happy coding maifen!!!
